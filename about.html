                <p>At a young age I found a real passion for problem solving. I enjoyed puzzle games, word problems, and critical
                    thinking. Its a combination of these elements that lead me down the path of learning code. Each new project
                    is a puzzle not yet put together. It is through this lense that I continue to learn and grow as a developer
                    each day. </p>

                <p>During college I was apart of a program that created websites for local businesses in the area. I worked
                    in a small team to provide an online presence for the assigned business. I was afforded the ability to
                    lead a small team of developers as well as first hand experience coding in a team environment. It was
                    here I began to learn the fundamentals of Html, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and php.</p>
