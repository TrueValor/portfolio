                <p>At a young age I found a real passion for problem solving. I enjoyed puzzle games, word problems, and
                    critical thinking. It's a combination of these elements that lead me down the path of learning code.
                    Each new project is a puzzle not yet put together. It is through this lense that I continue to learn
                    and grow as a developer each day. </p>

                <h3>Web Developer</h3>
                <h5>Full Stack Developer</h5>
                <p>During college I joined a program that created websites for local businesses in the area. I worked in
                    a small team to provide an online presence for the assigned business. I was afforded the ability to lead
                    a small team of developers as well as first hand experience coding in a team environment. It was here
                    I began to learn the fundamentals of Html, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and Php.</p>

                <p>While working at this media company I served on a small team of creators to design fully marketable brands,
                    logos, and marketing materials for local businesses. We also served smaller parties by providing professional
                    quality photo, video, and sound editing services at events such as weddings and graduations.</p>

                <p>To hone my skills I have recreated, redesigned, and built projects for companies as personal projects.
                    I also have built and reconstructed various open source projects. It's through this method that i have
                    developed skills in Sass and Node.js. I am currently in the process of learning and building projects
                    in Wordpress and Webflow. </p>
