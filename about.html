                <p>At a young age I found a real passion for problem solving. I enjoyed puzzle games, word problems, and
                    critical thinking. It's a combination of these elements that lead me down the path of learning code.
                    Each new project is a puzzle not yet put together. It is through this lense that I continue to learn
                    and grow as a developer each day. To find out more about me or to contact me, my resume and informaion
                    is provided below.</p>

                <h3>Web Developer</h3>
                <h5>Full Stack Developer</h5>
                <p>During college the program curriculum focused on creating and designing websites for local businesses
                    in the area. I worked in a small team to provide an online presence for various companies. I was afforded
                    the ability to lead my own team of developers as well as first hand experience coding in a group setting.
                    It was here I began to learn the fundamentals of Html, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and Php.</p>

                <h3>Graphic Designer</h3>
                <h5>StaTuned Media</h5>
                <p>While working at this media company I worked with a group of creators to design fully marketable brands,
                    logos, and marketing materials for businesses in the area. We also served smaller clientele by providing
                    professional quality photo, video, and sound editing services at events such as weddings and graduations.
                    My time here pushed my knowledge of marketing trends as well as a professional level understanding of
                    Adobe Photoshop and other editing tools.</p>

                <h5>Independent Studies</h5>
                <p>To hone my skills I have recreated, redesigned, and built projects for companies as personal projects.
                    I also have built and reconstructed various open source projects. It's through this method that i have
                    developed an understanding of Sass and Node.js. I am currently in the process of learning and building
                    projects in React and Webflow.</p>
